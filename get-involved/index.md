## Get involved


Members of the Make WordPress Accessibility Team are volunteers working on improvements to accessibility in WordPress for people with disabilities.

Not everybody contributing to WordPress is technically minded, and everyone who is connected with accessibility can contribute to the Accessibility team. We particularly want to hear from people who are regular users of assistive technology (AT), as your perspective is especially valuable testing accessibility fixes for WordPress.

The Accessibility team includes core committers, developers, testing specialists, content writers, and organizers; it could include you!

Each new version of WordPress brings accessibility improvements. The more discussion and testing we can do, the faster that rate of change can be.

## Join a Working Group

If you want to contribute to WordPress, there are several ways. It’s not just writing code! Join one of our working groups outlined below by contacting the point person in the #accessibility channel on Slack.

## Design Working Group

Coordinate with the WordPress Design team to monitor what kinds of design changes are happening in WordPress and help contribute to keeping accessibility at the forefront in design.

Contact: Needed!

## General Working Group

Monitor the broad accessibility of WordPress core and any areas of WordPress not covered by another working group. Monitors and contributes to tickets in the [core Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&focuses=~accessibility). The general team is primarily developers and testers.

- Writing patches for accessibility trac tickets
- Give code examples for trac tickets (the expected output)
- Help with the discussion & testing of possible solutions

Take a look at [the overview of accessibility tickets](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/get-involved/tickets-tasks-reports/) and take your pick.

## Gutenberg Working Group

We review Gutenberg accessibility-related issues, write and discuss tickets on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29) and write code patches. We need people who know how to [test for accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/get-involved/audits-and-testing/) and/or use assistive technology to test existing and new functionality.

- Monitor [changes to the Editor](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/gutenberg-testing/), both in Full Site Editing and in Block Editor
- Track goals for future versions of the editor and design changes
- Keep the team in the loop when major changes are planned
