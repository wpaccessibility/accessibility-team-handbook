# Site Feedback Guide

On occasion, the Make WordPress Accessible group has been asked to review a wordpress.org site and provide feedback on any accessibility issues. The following document contains a series of guidelines (organised by skill level and technology usage) that should enable you to do so — irrespective of whether you are a technical developer or a non-technical WordPress user.
