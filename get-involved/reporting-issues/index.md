# Report accessibility issues

## How to report an accessibility issue

Before adding a new issue, make an attempt to search existing tickets. If the issue already exists, consider making a comment on the existing ticket to help emphasize its importance or give additional context.

- You need a [WordPress.org account](https://login.wordpress.org/register) to create a ticket.
- If you find an accessibility issue in WordPress core, report it in the [WordPress trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/). Create a ticket with the focus “accessibility”, with the type “defect(bug)”.
- If you find an accessibility issue in the block editor or full site editing, report it in the [Gutenberg GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new/choose).
- If you find an issue in wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, or any other site on the wordpress.org domain, report it in the [Meta Trac](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/). Create a ticket with the type “defect”

Describe the issue in as much detail as you can. Please list the operating system, browser and any assistive technology you were using when you identified the issue, so we can reproduce it and work on a solution.
