## Audits and testing

WordPress regularly improves its features and creates new core themes. The accessibility team monitors these changes and tests them for web accessibility.

## What we test

- Core themes;
- New functionality added in WordPress;
- Existing functionality with known problems;
- Patches from tickets labeled “[accessibility](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&focuses=~accessibility)”.

## How we test

We use a variety of assistive technologies, including:

- Different brands of **screen readers** and **voice recognition software** on multiple browsers;
- **Keyboard only** navigation, checking tab-order and discovering unreachable links;
- **Color contrast checkers**;

Do you have something you’d like tested in WordPress core? Please contact us in Slack in the #accessibility channel to let us know.

## What we do with test results

We report problems by [creating a ticket](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-bugs/) on WordPress Trac. We test patches on existing tickets, then update those tickets with our findings. We discuss known accessibility problems and suggest workable solutions. We document these activities on [Make WordPress Accessible](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/accessibility-usertest/).

## How you can help

We are looking for people familiar with WordPress, with time to run tests, especially those who:

- Use assistive technology to use websites on a regular basis,
- Are subject-matter-experts in web accessibility or,
- Are web developers that can help write patches.
